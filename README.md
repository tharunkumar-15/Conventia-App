Alzheimer is a type of dementia which primarily causes thinking, remembering, reasoning, and behavioral abnormalities. People with Alzheimer tend to forget the memories such as their conversations with people which leads to incomplete activities, repetition of conversation, increased burden on caregivers.

A common strategy is to develop an app that will aid Alzheimer patients in remembering the past. Our proposed system is a user-friendly React Native application for people with Alzheimer to identify the person and then record, store and narrate the conversations made.

## Key Features ##
* Face recognition feature to identify and remember the person.
* Speaker Diarization feature to identify different speakers in an audio recording.
* An application that stores conversation automatically.
* Summarized storage of large conversations.
* Easy access to previous conversations.
